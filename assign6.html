                <p>
                    You just don’t understand economics, like supply and demand. Don't worry kiddo, where there's a
                    demand there will be a supply, we'll all have our roads.

                <h3>Is taxation theft?</h3>
                <p>
                    If I came to your house with heavily armed buddies, demanded that you and your neighbors give me a
                    percentage of your income, in return for some crappy monopolized services that you didn't ask for,
                    would you consider that theft?

                <p>
                    Libertarians want to live in a world where gay couples can protect their poppy fields with fully
                    automatic weapons. <br>
                    A world where voluntaryism and property rights are treated with the highest respect.
